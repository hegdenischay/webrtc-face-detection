## Getting started

- Clone this repository to your local workspace.
- Set these variables in the `Fleet Configuration` application side tab
  - `RESIN_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem` = `196`
  - `RESIN_HOST_CONFIG_start_x` = `1`

- Using [Balena CLI](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/cli/), push the code with `balena push <application-name>`.
- See the magic happening, your device is getting updated ðŸŒŸOver-The-AirðŸŒŸ!

### Extra

- To rotate the camera feed by 180 degrees, add a **device variable**: `rotation` = `1` (More information about this on the [docs](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/manage/serv-vars/)).
- If you want your device to be accessible over the internet, toggle the switch called `PUBLIC DEVICE URL`.
- Once your device finishes updating, you can watch the live feed by visiting your device's public URL.

## Additional Information

- This project uses [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) (a Real-Time Communication protocol).
- A direct WebRTC connection fails in some cases.
- This current version uses mjpeg streaming when the webRTC connection fails.
